# finding-aid-eligibility
In New York, there are so many people who are actually in need. There are myriad options to get any kind of aid from this lively city but unfortunately, very few people are aware of it. This problem inspired us to take action against it. We are focused to solve this problem by making an interactive website for the people who are eligible to get the aid and their family. Though this is a prototype, our plan is to implement it in the near future. We are using HTML5, Jason, CSS & Java Script to make this website. We believe that by creating this website we will be able to end the hunger of our community..
